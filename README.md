# TwitterAPI
Peek inside to see what my scripts do with Twitter API


get_trends.py --> Uses TwitterAPI wrapper tweepy and iso3166 module. This script asks the user for a country. It prints out the cities in that country for which trends are available. The user can now
enter cities until she/he is bored ;) and view up to 5 trends for each city. To change country; run
the script again.
